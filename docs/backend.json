    "reasoning": "Given the limited scope of the application (App Navigator with user authentication and a UI consisting of a top navigation bar and sidebar), the Firestore structure is relatively straightforward. We primarily need a place to store user data. The design prioritizes Authorization Independence. Since there are no collaborative features or complex relationships described, a simple path-based ownership model is sufficient and highly secure. This approach allows for clear security rules based solely on the `request.auth.uid`, avoiding any `get()` calls and ensuring atomicity.\n\n**Authorization Independence**: Achieved through path-based ownership in `/users/{userId}`. No denormalization is needed because there are no subcollections or collaborative features requiring inherited access rights.\n\n**QAPs**: Secure `list` operations are naturally supported because each user's data is isolated under their respective `/users/{userId}` path. Listing users is not a requirement based on the given info."
