/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the /users/{userId} collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, where {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing all users is implicitly denied, as list operations on /users are not permitted.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow rapid iteration. Only critical authorization fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The /users/{userId} path directly reflects the authenticated user's UID, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
