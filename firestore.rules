/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the App Navigator application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Path-based ownership is enforced for all read and write operations within the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal `id` field is enforced on create and update.

     * @description Controls access to user documents. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own document.
     * @path /users/{userId}
     * @allow (create) - User with UID 'user_abc' can create a document at /users/user_abc if the document's id field also contains 'user_abc'.
     * @allow (get, update, delete, list) - User with UID 'user_abc' can get, update, delete, or list documents at /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (create) - User with UID 'user_def' cannot create a document at /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (get, update, delete, list) - User with UID 'user_def' cannot get, update, or delete documents at /users/user_abc.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership and validates data consistency between the path and the document data.
